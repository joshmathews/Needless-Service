# Needless-Service
The 3,000-mile myth for oil change is promoted by the quick-lube industry's reminder windshield sticker. Car dealers' service departments are also guilty of incorrectly listing the mileage for the next oil change. We've seen them recommend a 3,000-mile oil change on a car with a 10,000-mile interval and also list a 5,000-mile recommendation on a car that has a variable oil change schedule. Because busy car owners read their owner's manuals, most have no idea of the actual oil change interval for their cars and so they blindly follow the windshield reminder sticker, whether it is correct or not. Most people follow the windshield reminder sticker for service otherwise they donâ€™t know about the service intervals. A career Navy mechanic who bought a long-term car just shrugged when he was told that the vehicle had safely gone 13,000 miles between oil changes. I'll just keep changing the oil every 5,000 miles, he said. It's worked well for me in the past. Our oil-change addiction also comes from the erroneous argument that nearly all cars should be serviced under the severe schedule found in the owner's manual. In fact, a quiz on the Web site maintained by Jiffy Lube International Inc. recommends the severe maintenance schedule for virtually every kind of driving pattern. <a href="http://www.cartrapped.com/drowsy-driving-can-quickly-lead-to-a-collision">Car trapped guide</a> will help you to tell about the service time interval.
